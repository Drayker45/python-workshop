# Run Ubuntu 18.04 with VirtualBox

## Install VirtualBox
Navigate to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. Choose the package that suits your Operating System.

## Download Ubuntu 18.04 ISO image
Download from https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/. Choose the Desktop image that comes with graphic interface.

## Create a VM
I found a very good tutorial [here](https://brb.nci.nih.gov/seqtools/installUbuntu.html). 
You can follow the steps, except using Ubuntu 18.04 instead of 14.04.

## Take a snapshot
After you have a satisfactory environment, take a snapshot. 
If you mess up with anything and do not know how to fix it, you can easily revert to this snapshot.
To take a snapshot, click on Machine -> Take Snapshot, 
enter a name and add some meaningful description to help you remember what the snapshot is. 

It's a good practice to take snapshots once in a while, in particular after you have finished some important setups.
